OpenToken
=========

A Clojure implementation of [OpenToken](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-smith-opentoken-02).

TODO: Although the decode function makes use of the key-info encoded in the 
token to allow for selection of the decryption key per the spec, there is
no mechanism to encode the key-info field at present.
